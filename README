Local manifest addon for building AOSP Jelly Bean for the PrimoC/U

Getting Started
---------------

Make a build directory:

	mkdir Andoid (or whatever name you choose)
	cd Android (or the name  you chose)
	

To initialize your local repository using the AOSP manifest, use commands like these:

    repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest.git -b master
    
    curl -L -o .repo/local_manifest.xml -O -L https://raw.github.com/Aosp-Primo/local_manifest/master/local_manifest.xml

    	( or Download: https://github.com/Aosp-Primo/local_manifest/blob/master/local_manifest.xml
		and place it in ~/Android/.repo/local_manifest.xml (or ~/'name you chose'/.repo)

Then to sync up:

    repo sync --current-branch

And finally to build the AOSP ROM:

    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch 
    (pick number of device)
    make -j4 otapackage

Look for out/target/product/device/ for the zip
